# Week-wise progeress:

  This project is created by me under the mentorship of Aarti kushwaha. She is guiding us throughout the project.By the week one we created the UI of the our extension and applied some styling to it. Next week we connected to api and fetch the results to the screen, and at last we did the final styling to the UI and imported fonts to the site to make our extension looks better.
